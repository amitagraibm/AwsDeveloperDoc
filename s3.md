S3 definition
S3 is AWS Simple Storage Service.
S3 is object storage, as opposed to file or block storage.

Objects
Objects are like files.
Objects consist of:

Key (name)
Value (data)
Version ID
Metadata

S3 objects can be as small as 0 bytes (potential exam question)
S3 objects can be as large as 5 TB (potential exam question)

Buckets
Buckets hold objects.
Buckets have global namespace (like domain names)


Storage classes
S3 storage classes offer tradeoffs among availability, durability, retrieval time, and price.
Intelligent tiering
Machine learning assigns buckets to the best access tier.


Standard
11 9s availability (99.99999999999%)

Standard Infrequently Accessed (IA)
50% cheaper than standard
For objects accessed less than once per month

One-Zone IAdafdsadf sda
99.5% availability
70% cheaper than standard, 20% cheaper than Standard IA

Glacier
Low cost
Retrieval takes hours

Glacier Deep Archive

Lowest cost
12 hour retrieval time


Deploying static sites with S3

Disadvantages:
Not atomic
Not Git-centric


Alternatives:

AWS Amplify Console
Netlify
Vercel


From Netlify docs:

With FTP or S3 uploads, each file is just pushed live one after the other, so you can easily get into situations where a new HTML page is live before the supporting assets (images, scripts, CSS) have been uploaded. And if your connection cuts out in the middle of an upload, your site could get stuck in a broken state for a long time.
Atomic deploys guarantee that your site is always consistent.
